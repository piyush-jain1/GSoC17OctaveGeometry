## Perform boolean operation on polygon(s) using one of boolean methods.
##
## @var{inpol} = Nx2 matrix of (X, Y) coordinates constituting the polygons(s)
## to be clipped. Polygons are separated by [NaN NaN] rows. @var{clippol} =
## another Nx2 matrix of (X, Y) coordinates representing the clip polygon(s).
##
## The argument @var{op}, the boolean operation, can be:
##
## @itemize
## @item 0: difference @var{inpol} - @var{clippol}
##
## @item 1: intersection ("AND") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol} (= default)
##
## @item 2: exclusiveOR ("XOR") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol}
##
## @item 3: union ("OR") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol}
## @end itemize
##

## Output array @var{outpol} will be an Nx2 array of polygons resulting from
## the requested boolean operation

## Optional output argument @var{npol} indicates the number of output polygons.
