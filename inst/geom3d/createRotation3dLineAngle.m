%     line = [origin direction];
%     angle = pi/3;
%     rot = createRotation3dLineAngle(line, angle);

% determine rotation center and direction
center = [0 0 0];
if size(line, 2)==6
    center = line(1:3);
    vector = line(4:6);
else
    vector = line;
end

% normalize vector
v = normalizeVector3d(vector);

% compute projection matrix P and anti-projection matrix
P = v'*v;
Q = [0 -v(3) v(2) ; v(3) 0 -v(1) ; -v(2) v(1) 0];
I = eye(3);

% compute vectorial part of the transform
mat = eye(4);
mat(1:3, 1:3) = P + (I - P)*cos(theta) + Q*sin(theta);

% add translation coefficient
mat = recenterTransform3d(mat, center);
