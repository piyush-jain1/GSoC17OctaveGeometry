%   Create a 3D mesh representing a dodecahedron
%   V is the 20-by-3 array of vertex coordinates
%   E is the 30-by-2 array of edge vertex indices
%   F is the 12-by-5 array of face vertex indices
%
%   [V, F] = createDodecahedron;
%   Returns only the vertices and the face vertex indices.
%
%   MESH = createDodecahedron;
%   Returns the data as a mesh structure, with fields 'vertices', 'edges'
%   and 'faces'.
%
%   Example
%   [v, e, f] = createDodecahedron;
%   drawMesh(v, f);
%
%   Use values given by P. Bourke, see:
%   http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/platonic/
%   faces are re-oriented to have normals pointing outwards.
