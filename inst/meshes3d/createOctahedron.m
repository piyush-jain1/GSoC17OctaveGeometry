%   Create a 3D mesh representing an octahedron
%   V is a 6-by-3 array with vertices coordinate, E is a 12-by-2 array
%   containing indices of neighbour vertices, and F is a 8-by-3 array
%   containing array of vertex index for each face.
%
%   [V, F] = createOctahedron;
%   Returns only the vertices and the face vertex indices.
%
%   MESH = createOctahedron;
%   Returns the data as a mesh structure, with fields 'vertices', 'edges'
%   and 'faces'.
%
%   Vertices are located on grid vertices:
%    ( ±1,  0,  0 )
%    (  0, ±1,  0 )
%    (  0,  0, ±1 )
%
%   Edge length of returned octahedron is sqrt(2).
%   Surface area of octahedron is 2*sqrt(3)*a^2, approximately 6.9282 in
%   this case.
%   Volume of octahedron is sqrt(2)/3*a^3, approximately 1.3333 in this
%   case.
%
%   Example
%     [v, e, f] = createOctahedron;
%     drawMesh(v, f);
