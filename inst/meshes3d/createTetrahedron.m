%CREATETETRAHEDRON Create a 3D mesh representing a tetrahedron
%
%   [V, E, F] = createTetrahedron
%   create a simple tetrahedron, using mesh representation. The tetrahedron
%   is inscribed in the unit cube.
%   V is a 4-by-3 array with vertex coordinates, 
%   E is a 6-by-2 array containing indices of neighbour vertices,
%   F is a 4-by-3 array containing vertices array of each (triangular) face.
%
%   [V, F] = createTetrahedron;
%   Returns only the vertices and the faces.
%
%   MESH = createTetrahedron;
%   Returns the data as a mesh structure, with fields 'vertices', 'edges'
%   and 'faces'.
%
%
%   Example
%   % Create and display a tetrahedron
%   [V, E, F] = createTetrahedron;
%   drawMesh(V, F);
