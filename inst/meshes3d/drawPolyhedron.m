%DRAWPOLYHEDRON Draw polyhedron defined by vertices and faces
%
%   drawPolyhedron(NODES, FACES)
%   Draws the polyhedron defined by vertices NODES and the faces FACES. 
%   NODES is a NV-by-3 array containing coordinates of vertices, and FACES
%   is either a NF-by3 or NF-by-4 array containing indices of vertices of
%   the triangular or rectangular faces.
%   FACES can also be a cell array, in the content of each cell is an array
%   of indices to the nodes of the current face. Faces can have different
%   number of vertices.
%   
%   H = drawPolyhedron(...);
%   Also returns a handle to the created patche.
%
%   Example:
%   [n f] = createSoccerBall;
%   drawPolyhedron(n, f);

%   HISTORY
%   07/11/2005 update doc.
%   04/01/2007 typo
%   18/01/2007 add support for 2D polyhedra ("nodes" is N-by-2 array), and
%       make 'cnodes' a list of points instead of a list of indices
%   14/08/2007 add comment, add support for NaN in faces (complex polygons)
%   14/09/2007 rename as drawPolyhedron
%   16/10/2008 better support for colors
%   27/07/2010 copy to 'drawMesh'
