function alpha = meshDihedralAngles(vertices, edges, faces)
%MESHDIHEDRALANGLES Dihedral at edges of a polyhedal mesh
%
%   ALPHA = meshDihedralAngles(V, E, F)
%   where V, E and F represent vertices, edges and faces of a mesh,
%   computes the dihedral angle between the two adjacent faces of each edge
%   in the mesh. ALPHA is a column array with as many rows as the number of
%   edges. The i-th element of ALPHA corresponds to the i-th edge.
%
%   Note: the function assumes that the faces are correctly oriented. The
%   face vertices should be indexed counter-clockwise when considering the
%   supporting plane of the face, with the outer normal oriented outwards
%   of the mesh.
%
%   Example
%   [v e f] = createCube;
%   rad2deg(meshDihedralAngles(v, e, f))
%   ans =
