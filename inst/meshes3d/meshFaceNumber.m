function nFaces = meshFaceNumber(varargin)
%MESHFACENUMBER Returns the number of faces in this mesh
%
%   NF = meshFaceNumber(V, F)
%   NF = meshFaceNumber(V, E, F)
%   NF = meshFaceNumber(MESH)
%   Returns the number of faces in the given mesh. As the face array may be
%   represented either as numeric array or as cell array of indices, this
%   function is a convenient way to get the number of faces independanlty
%   of the mesh representation.
%
%   Example
%     [v f] = createCube;
%     meshFaceNumber(v, f)
%     ans =
%         6
