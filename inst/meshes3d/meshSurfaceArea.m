function area = meshSurfaceArea(vertices, edges, faces)
%MESHSURFACEAREA Surface area of a polyhedral mesh
%
%   S = meshSurfaceArea(V, F)
%   S = meshSurfaceArea(V, E, F)
%   Computes the surface area of the mesh specified by vertex array V and
%   face array F. Vertex array is a NV-by-3 array of coordinates. 
%   Face array can be a NF-by-3 or NF-by-4 numeric array, or a Nf-by-1 cell
%   array, containing vertex indices of each face.
%
%   This functions iterates on faces, extract vertices of the current face,
%   and computes the sum of face areas.
%
%   This function assumes faces are coplanar and convex. If faces are all
%   triangular, the function "trimeshSurfaceArea" should be more efficient.
%
%
%   Example
%     % compute the surface of a unit cube (should be equal to 6)
%     [v f] = createCube;
%     meshSurfaceArea(v, f)
%     ans = 
%         6
