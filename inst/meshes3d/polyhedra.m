function polyhedra(varargin)
%POLYHEDRA Index of classical polyhedral meshes
%   
%   Polyhedra are specific meshes, with additional assumptions:
%   * the set of faces is assumed to enclose a single 3D domain
%   * each face has a neighbor face for each edge
%   * some functions also assume that normals of all faces point ouwards 
%
%   Example
%   % create a soccer ball mesh and display it
%   [n e f] = createSoccerBall;
%   drawMesh(n, f, 'faceColor', 'g', 'linewidth', 2);
%   axis equal;
