%REMOVEMESHVERTICES Remove vertices and associated faces from a mesh
%
%   [V2, F2] = removeMeshVertices(VERTS, FACES, VERTINDS)
%   Removes the vertices specified by the vertex indices VERTINDS, and
%   remove the faces containing one of the removed vertices.
%
%
%   Example
%     % remove some vertices from a soccerball polyhedron
%     [v, f] = createSoccerBall; 
%     plane = createPlane([.6 0 0], [1 0 0]);
%     indAbove = find(~isBelowPlane(v, plane));
%     [v2, f2] = removeMeshVertices(v, f, indAbove);
%     drawMesh(v2, f2);
%     axis equal; hold on;
