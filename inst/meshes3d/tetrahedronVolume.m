%TETRAHEDRONVOLUME Signed volume of a tetrahedron
%
%   VOL = tetrahedronVolume(TETRA)
%   Comptues the siged volume of the tetrahedron TETRA defined by a 4-by-4
%   array representing the polyhedron vertices.
%
%   Example
%     vi = [0 0 0;1 0 0;0 1 0;0 0 1];
%     tetrahedronVolume(vi)
%     ans = 
%         0.1667
%
%     [V F] = createTetrahedron;
%     tetrahedronVolume(V)
%     ans =
