function [tri, inds] = triangulateFaces(faces)
%TRIANGULATEFACES Convert face array to an array of triangular faces 
%
%   TRI = triangulateFaces(FACES)
%   Returns a 3-columns array of indices, based on the data stored in the
%   argument FACES:
%   - if FACES is a N-by-3 array, returns the same array
%   - if FACES is a N-by-4 array, returns an array with 2*N rows and 3
%       columns, splitting each square into 2 triangles (uses first and
%       third vertex of each square as diagonal).
%   - if FACES is a cell array, split each face into a set of triangles,
%       and returns the union of all triangles. Faces are assumed to be
%       convex.
%
%   [TRI INDS] = triangulateFaces(FACES)
%   Also returns original face index of each new triangular face. INDS has
%   the same number of rows as TRI, and has values between 1 and the
%   number of rows of the original FACES array.
%
%
%   Example
%     % create a basic shape
%     [n e f] = createCubeOctahedron;
%     % draw with plain faces
%     figure;
%     drawMesh(n, f);
%     % draw as a triangulation
%     tri = triangulateFaces(f);
%     figure;
%     patch('vertices', n, 'faces', tri, 'facecolor', 'r');
