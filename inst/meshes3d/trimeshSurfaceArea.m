function area = trimeshSurfaceArea(v, e, f)
%TRIMESHSURFACEAREA Surface area of a triangular mesh
%
%   S = trimeshSurfaceArea(V, F)
%   S = trimeshSurfaceArea(V, E, F)
%   Computes the surface area of the mesh specified by vertex array V and
%   face array F. Vertex array is a NV-by-3 array of coordinates. 
%   Face array is a NF-by-3, containing vertex indices of each face.
%
%   Example
%     % Compute area of an octahedron (equal to 2*sqrt(3)*a*a, with 
%     % a = sqrt(2) in this case)
%     [v f] = createOctahedron;
%     trimeshSurfaceArea(v, f)
%     ans = 
%         6.9282
%
%     % triangulate a compute area of a unit cube
%     [v f] = createCube;
%     f2 = triangulateFaces(f);
%     trimeshSurfaceArea(v, f2)
%     ans =
%         6
