function normals = vertexNormal(vertices, faces)
%VERTEXNORMAL Compute normals to a mesh vertices
%
%   N = vertexNormal(V, F)
%   Computes vertex normals of the mesh given by vertices V and F. 
%   V is a vertex array with 3 columns, F is either a NF-by-3 or NF-by-4
%   index array, or a cell array with NF elements.
%
%   Example
%     % Draw the vertex normals of a sphere
%     s = [10 20 30 40];
%     [v f] = sphereMesh(s);
%     drawMesh(v, f);
%     view(3);axis equal; light; lighting gouraud;
%     normals = vertexNormal(v, f);
%     drawVector3d(v, normals);
