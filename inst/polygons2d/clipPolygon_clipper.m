## Perform boolean operation on polygon(s) using one of boolean methods.
##
## @var{inpol} = Nx2 matrix of (X, Y) coordinates constituting the polygons(s)
## to be clipped.  Polygons are separated by [NaN NaN] rows.  @var{clippol} =
## another Nx2 matrix of (X, Y) coordinates representing the clip polygon(s).
##
## Optional argument @var{op}, the boolean operation, can be:
##
## @itemize
## @item 0: difference @var{inpol} - @var{clippol}
##
## @item 1: intersection ("AND") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol} (= default)
##
## @item 2: exclusiveOR ("XOR") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol}
##
## @item 3: union ("OR") of @var{inpol} and @var{clippol}
## @end itemize
##
## In addition a rule can be specified to instruct polyclip how to assess
## holes, or rather, how to assess polygon fill.  This works as follows: start
## with a winding number of zero (0).  From a point outside all polygons
## specified in @var{INPOL}, go to the center of the innermost polygon and note
## which polygons are crossed.  For each polygon boundary crossing from right
## to left, increase the winding number, while for each polygon crossing from
## left to right, decrement it, and then assign it to the crossed polygon.
## @var{rules} and @var{rulec} can be set individually for subject and clip
## polygons, respectively, as follows:
##
## @itemize
## @item 0 Even-Odd, also called Alternate (= default):
## The first polygon crossed specifies the outer boundary of a filled polygon,
## the next polygon (if present) specifies the inner boundary of that filled
## polygon, and so on. Winding direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is
## irrelevant here.
##
## @item 1 Non-Zero:
## All polygons with a non-zero winding number are filled.
##
## @item 2 Positive:
## All polygons with a winding number > 0 are filled. This is the usual setting
## for counterclockwise polygons to be the outer, and clockwise polygons to be
## the inner boundary ("holes") of complex polygons.
##
## @item 3 Negative:
## All polygons with a winding number < 0 are filled.
## @end itemize
## (for details see
## @uref{http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/Units/ClipperLib/Types/PolyFillType.htm}
##
## Output array @var{outpol} will be an Nx2 array of polygons resulting from
## the requested boolean operation, or in case of just one input argument an
## Nx1 array indicating winding direction of each subpolygon in input argument
## @var{inpol}.
