## @deftypefn {} {@var{outpol} =} joinPolygons (@var{inpol})
## Convert a cell style set of polygons into an array of subpolygons
## separated by NaN rows.
##
## @var{inpol} is expected to be an Nx1 (column) cell array with each cell
## containing a matrix of Mx1 (X), Mx2 (X,Y), or Mx3 (X,Y,Z) coordinates.
##
## @var{outpol} is a numeric Px1, Px2 or Px3 array os subpolygons each
## separated by a row of NaN values.
